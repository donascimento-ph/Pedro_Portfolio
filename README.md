# [Project 1: Black Friday Sale: Exploratory Analysis](https://github.com/donascimento-ph/Pedro_Portfolio/blob/main/Black%20Friday%20Sale%20Exploratory%20Analysis.ipynb)

* Data collection and preparation: The first step in this project was to collect data on customer purchases during Black Friday, including information on the user ID, product ID, gender, age, occupation, city category, stay in current city years, marital status, and product categories.

* Exploratory data analysis: The next step was to conduct an exploratory data analysis to identify patterns and relationships in the data. This was done by visualizing the data.

* Business problem solution proposal: Insights from the data were used to propose solutions for the business problem of declining sales during Black Friday. This includes developing a targeted marketing strategy to attract specific target groups, and to offer special discounts or promotions on the products that are of most interest to those groups.
